All files with haskell code are properly documented in code. Moreover:
- All Tasks have been implemented in the .source file. 
- Each Task solution has a different .hs file with the number of Task as name of the Task.
- Each of the above Tasks is well documented and has haddock comments about their functionality.
- There is also a test suite which performs some simple doctest's just to show that the results are correct. In order to run this test, we just type: stack test.
